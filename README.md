**Algorithm and Time Complexity:**

**FAQ:** Before implementing any algorithm:
- Can my algorithm retrive the result **IN-TIME**
- For How much **Big Input Value Size** my algorithm can work?
- How much memory is using by my Algorithm?

There is three possible sinario for analysis the complexity of Algorithm.
1. Worst Case Senario
2. Best Case Senario
3. Average Case Senario


Suppose we have a sudo code of algorithm. Now we want to 
The meaning of calculating complexity is, "**How much instructions are using by the Algorithm?"**

**Senario One::**
Suppose an instruction for calculating the multiplacation of two number. So here is only a instruction.

**Senario Two::**
And now suppose a loop of 100 times where each time has one instruction so there is 100 Instruction.

How much time will be taken for previewing these result ; that will be depends on CPU Process time but time complexity actually not meant that. 

**Time Complexity actually means that how much qualityful our algorithm is!!**
**So this is a parameter scale for calculting the efficiency of an algorithm.** 

BIG _O_ is the notation for writing Time Complexity.

```
int calculate (int value) {
  int sum = value + 10;
  sum = sum / 2;
  return sum;
}
```
It's complexity is o(1). So, this is an example of constant time complexity.
